# Adaptive AI/ML Control Framework

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-brightgreen)](https://devloper-gazi.github.io/Adaptive-AI-ML-Control-Framework/)

An interactive exploration of an advanced architecture for predictive analytics and system optimization. ✨

## Overview 🚀

The framework creates a **closed-loop system** that continuously learns from data to predict future states and make optimal control decisions. It combines **time-series forecasting** (LSTM) with **reinforcement learning** (RL) for dynamic parameter adjustment.

## Architecture 🏗️

1. **Data Ingestion** 📥: Collects and preprocesses time-series data.
2. **Predictive Model** 🔮: LSTM networks for forecasting.
3. **Optimization Engine** 🤖: RL agents for decision making.
4. **Control & Feedback** 🔁: Executes actions and learns from results.

## Global Research 🌍

- **Israel** 🇮🇱: Autonomous systems (drone swarms)
- **China** 🇨🇳: Smart infrastructure (energy grids)
- **Switzerland** 🇨🇭: Precision manufacturing (robotics)
- **UK** 🇬🇧: Healthcare (insulin delivery)
