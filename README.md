[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-brightgreen)](https://devloper-gazi.github.io/Adaptive-AI-ML-Control-Framework/)

An interactive exploration of an advanced architecture for predictive analytics and system optimization.

## Overview

The Adaptive AI/ML Control Framework creates a closed-loop system that continuously learns from incoming data to predict future states and make optimal control decisions. It integrates time-series forecasting with reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust system parameters, ensuring efficiency, stability, and responsiveness in complex, changing environments.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
Collects, pre-processes, and normalizes raw time-series data from various sensors and system logs. Ensures data quality and consistency through noise filtering, handling missing values, and feature scaling.

### 2. Predictive Model Layer
Utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to generate predictions for future system states based on historical data, providing forecasts of the environment's future behavior.

### 3. Optimization Engine Layer
Employs Reinforcement Learning agents (Q-learning or policy gradient methods) to explore action sequences and find policies that maximize long-term rewards, outputting optimal control parameters.

### 4. Control & Feedback Layer
Translates optimal actions into system commands and feeds resulting state changes back into the ingestion layer, creating a continuous learning loop.

## Technical Implementation

### LSTM for Prediction
LSTMs handle long-term dependencies in sequential data through a specialized architecture with input, forget, and output gates:

- **Forget Gate**: $f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$
- **Input Gate**: $i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)$
- **Cell State**: $C_t = f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot \tanh(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)$
- **Output Gate**: $h_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \odot \tanh(C_t)$

### Reinforcement Learning
Uses the Bellman equation for Q-learning updates:
$Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha [R + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]$

Where:
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $\gamma$ is the discount factor
- $R$ is the immediate reward
- $\max_{a'} Q(s',a')$ is the maximum expected future reward
